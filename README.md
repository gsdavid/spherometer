# spherometer

Apparently, the way github renders the source notebook IS NOT EXACTLY LIKE Jupyter itself.
In particular, there seems to be an issue with using HTML to insert figures into a cell.
In any case, the figures are not showing up here, but do show when rendered on my local 
computer. I will have to look into this issue and see if there is a FAQ about it.



Math and code explaining how a spherometer works (for example, to make a telescope mirror).

This is my first github project; the included Jupyter notebook project documents my struggles to 
learn how a spherometer works and to understand the mathematics behind the calculations.
As such, it is a travel story through my research int these ideas and techniques. 

Research is messy and often a tangle of false starts, incomplete ideas, and total mistakes.

As opposed to learning a subject from a textbook, or under the supervision of an expert, 
researching something on your own is almost never a nice cleaan path from start to finish.
So, don't expect this (at least this initial) notebook version to be pretty, and especially
don't expect it to be very didactic. Currently, it is mostly in a temporal order across several
weeks where I was trying (often unsuccessfully) to figure these things out.

Nevertheless, the study of spherometers and the math used to go from a few simple measurements
of a thin, spherical mirror to the expected focal length of that spherical mirror is really quite
interesting. Its history spans a time frame from the origins of geometry to the mechanical tools we use today.
Along the way we find the tracks of geniuses (Euclid, Archimedes, Heron, and on to Newton). I'm sure
there are numerous mechanical geniuses, too. They were the ones who discovered how to make such 
precise measuring instruments (calipers, dial gauges, and calibration plane surfaces, for example).

All of this work springs from an interest in the physicality of making scientific instruments.

Here, I am not interested in belittling technology nor hands-on work of any sort in contrast to 
Plato and his disdain for anything but pure thought about the unchangable forms as ideals.

I have come to believe that his approach misled Western Civilization and continues to make our science 
unnecessarily inaccessible. Rather, I would privelege the body working with materials in hand and
a phemenalogical mind plugged into the world speaking to the instrument builder as much as the 
instrument maker speaks to (or manipulates) that world. 

In the real world, we get stuck and often have no idea how to proceed. However, if we can 
simply calm down and be patient an idea will come to us, and we will
often find a way to move forward (whether one is doing metal work, or coding a computer). 

Pirsig speaks directly of this phenomena in his master work, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. 
David Abrams tell us in his book, The Spell of the Sensuous, that mind is deeply embedded in the world, 
and without the connection to the world, Mind can hardly consider how to function. That it works more 
like an appliance that is inert until being plugged into the  electric grid, completing a circuit from 
the world to the appliance. The same is true about minds; we need to be plugged in to the physicality 
around us. 

Indeed, it is hard to really think of mind and  body outside of that physicality and it is 
even harder to imagine exactly where one ends and the other begins. We think together 
with the structures of the world around us. We learn by doing in that world.

It was with this background that I first began to imagine an alternative to Greek thought, and a way
of learning science by constructing and using instruments. Grinding ones own reflective mirror for
a newtonian telescope is a project of exploration, and an invitation to becomes "the eyes of the world,"
as the Grateful Dead tell us. So, while this notebook has a bunch of math, it is incomplete without the
construction of your own spherometer and then your own mirrors. 

Enjoy the struggle to manipulate the material world into precision instruments, and to think with 
the minds and bodies of all those geniuses who have preceded us.
