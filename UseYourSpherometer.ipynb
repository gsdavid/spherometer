    "\n",
    "A spherometer is an instrument for measuring the curvature of a surface. For example, when grinding a \n",

    "A spherometer consists of soldi plane supported by three legs and having\n",

    "### The General Formula from Trikha and Bhatia(1958)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thrikha and Bhatia state that one commonly used formula is based on the assumption that the three legs\n",
    "of the spherometer form an perfect equalateral triangle with the pole of the dial gauge in exactly the \n",
    "center and probing exactly perpendicular to the plane defined by the spherometer legs. These conditions \n",
    "are never met in pratice, especially with do it your self techniques. Consequently, they they solve the \n",
    "equation more generally for when the three edges of the triangle can have different lengths $a_1, a_2$, and $a_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the problem is to, first, find the radius of the circum-circle around the legs of the spherometer, \n",
    "and, then to relate that small radius to the larger radius, $R$, which is the radius of curvature of the sphere being measured. See the **figure above**, for a representation of the problem, the placement of the spherometer, and the measurement to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, in this section, I will give the formulas without motivation and without proof; however, I'll show the proofs later. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The radius, $\\rho$, of the circum-circle of a triangle with length of sides as $a, b$, and $c$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\frac {a b c} {4 \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$s = \\frac {a+b+c} {2}$$. N.B., the Trikha and Bhatia paper is a scanned version of the journal and the root \n",
    "is not perfectly readable. However, they do state that when $a=b=c$, which is the ideal case, \n",
    "$\\rho = a\\   / \\sqrt{3}$. This statement can be used to show that the formula read square root, rather than cube root.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the radius of the spherometer, $\\rho$, then $R$, the radius of the measured sphere having sagitta, $h$, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R= \\frac {h}{2} + \\frac{a^2 b^2 c^2} {32 h s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)}.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Waite made measurements $a=4.820$, $b=4.800$, and $c= 4.791$ inches between his spherometer legs. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "He measured $h$, the sagitta, to be 0.0315 inches. He then computes the the RoC to be 121.95. However, I think\n",
    "his formula is slightly problematic. He does get close to the advertised delivered radius of 120 inches though.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do when using the Trikha and Bhata general equation with Waite's measurements?  The calculation \n",
    "in the next cell gives $R=122.1$ inches.\n",

    "Basically, we find approximately the same number as Waite, even though the formulas are different from \n",

    "## The math behind the use of a spherometer\n",
    "\n",
    "When I initially wrote the previous sections, I only had the spherometer equation. I had seen a few comments in Stackoverflow that suggested how to solve for the Radius of Curvature given spherometer geometry measurements. However, I didn't understand how the equation came about. In searching the internet for the derivations of these formulas, I found \n",
    "suggestions included using determinates and analytic geometry, others were optimization based ideas. All of these approaches were by coders, and for coders, which is fine ... a solution is a solution. However, there is something beautiful about doing the actual geometry and algebra to derive the required equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have, *finally*, thought about the geometry sufficiently, and have remembered, or looked up enough math to be able to derive the equation in Trikha and Bhatia. The proofs require no calculus and no explicit linear algebra with matrix solutions; though the sets of equations do have to be solved using, sometimes messy, simple algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to write this up for various reasons. First, I'll probably need to be able to come back to it some time in the future, and I'd like to be able to understand it when I do need it again. Second, there is a kind of beauty in the math that gets us to the sphereometer equation. Third, and perhaps most importantly, I wanted to call some attention to the historical path that leads from the first inklings of geometry, to the lion himself, Newton, who built the first reflecting telescope, and from there out to the stars and the edges of the universe. It is a magestic story.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we deeply consider the derivation, let me very briefly, and conscisely describe the heart of the proof, which involves finding the radius of curvature of a spherical mirror using only a spherometer, which itself has been carefully measured so that we know the distances between the end points of its three legs that touch the surface of the mirror (which is the physical and accessible part of the mathematical sphere in question).\n",

    "\n",
    "**First**, given the sagittal measurement, $h$, and the calculation of the radius, $\\rho$ of the circle delimiting the edge of a thin section sliced from the sphere, **determine** its unknown radius, $R$. This calculation\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red;\">**requires the chord theorem**</span> for the products of intersecting chord lengths, and results in a solution for $R$ that only depends on the measured sagittal height, and the calculated value of $\\rho$ which is wholely determined by the physical, measurable geometry of the spherometer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**, given access to the physical spherometer, **measure the distances between the three legs**, and then **calculate** the radius $\\rho$ of the circle that circumscribes those three points.

However, for a real telescope mirror (unlike our slice of watermelon) the slice determined by the legs of a spherometer is not really physical.

For a real mirror, we would have to measure the inside of the surface of the sphere, which is why we are imagining grinding away the red and white parts of the melon. To make the measurement we will use a spherometer, which is an instrument with three legs that just touch the green circle and a dial gauge that reaches down from the plane of the slice to measure the sagittal distance, $h$, reaching to the skin on the top of our slice. \n",
